This setting specifies whether a MIDI control that is assigned to a UI control should be excempted from further processing. The default value for this is `true` (so HISE will not forward a MIDI control message to its internal processing chain if it was assigned to a UI control), but for some projects you might want to enable this to be able to process all MIDI messages, regardless of the MIDI assignments.
