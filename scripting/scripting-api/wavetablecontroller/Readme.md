This API class will provide methods for customizing the resynthesis feature of the [Wavetable Synthesiser](/hise-modules/sound-generators/list/wavetablesynth).

Create this object with [Synth.getWavetableController()](/scripting/scripting-api/synth#getwavetablecontroller), then call one of the methods to setup the resynthesis.
