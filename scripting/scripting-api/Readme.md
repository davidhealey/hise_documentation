## Scripting API

**HISE** provides a API with over 200 functions which allow interaction between the core engine and the script processor. There is a complete list of all API calls in the [API Collection](/ui-components/floating-tiles/hise/apicollection), but you can also use the [Autocomplete Popup](/working-with-hise/hise-interface/code-editor#autocomplete-popup-[esc]) in the Script Editor to quickly browse through all available functions.
