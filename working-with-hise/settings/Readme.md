![SettingsWindow](/images/custom/settingswindow.png) 
You can change the preferences of HISE in the settings dialog, which opens when you click on the Settings icon on the top right of HISE or with **File > Settings**. The settings are organized into multiple categories.

## Setting files

HISE will create XML files for each setting category at the sensible location for this:

- Project and User settings will be stored in the Project folder (`ProjectInfo.xml` and `UserSettings.xml`)
- the other settings will be stored in the HISE app data folder.

## Categories

| Category | Description |
| --- | ------- |
| [Project Settings](/working-with-hise/settings/project) | The project specific settings |
| [Development Settings](/working-with-hise/settings/development) | The preferences for development in HISE |
| [Audio Settings](/working-with-hise/settings/audio-midi) | The audio settings dialogue. |
