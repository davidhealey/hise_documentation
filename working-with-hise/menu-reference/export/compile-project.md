Opens a combined "Compile Project" dialog that helps you through the compilation process. 

Select if you want to export your plugin as: 
- Plugin 
- Standalone App 

To compile your project as:
- Instrument
- FX Plugin
- Midi Plugin

After you hit Compile the compilation will start and present you with a verbose compilation log that will keep you informed about warnings (yellow) and errors (red). 

You can minimize the window if the compilation process might take some time and you want to continue working.
