With the **Sample Editor** you get a dedicated workspace for mapping samples and playing them back in a [Sampler](/hise-modules/sound-generators/list/streamingsampler). 

It shows:
- a [Sample Editor](/working-with-hise/hise-interface/sampler-workspace/sample-editor) to edit single samples.
- a [Map Editor](/working-with-hise/hise-interface/sampler-workspace/sample-map-editor) to map the samples into [SampleMaps](/hise-modules/sound-generators/list/streamingsampler#sample-maps).  
- a [Sample Table](/working-with-hise/hise-interface/sampler-workspace/sample-table) which lists all samples loaded into the current Sample Map.


If you want to change the [Settings](/working-with-hise/hise-interface/sampler-workspace/sample-settings) of the sampler you can do so by opening the [Sampler](/hise-modules/sound-generators/list/streamingsampler) popup in the [Module Tree](/working-with-hise/hise-interface/left-panel/module-tree).
