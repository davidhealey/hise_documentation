The **API Browser** gives you full access to HISEs [Scripting API](/scripting/scripting-api).

When you click on one of the functions, a popup will open that shows the documentation string of the function and displays its return type.
You can peak further into the docs with [F1], or paste the function to the current position of the cursor in the Code Editor with [Enter].
