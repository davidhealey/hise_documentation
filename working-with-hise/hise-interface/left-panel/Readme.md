The **Left Panel** in the HISE interface is the place where you build the DSP architecture of your project in the [Module Tree](/working-with-hise/hise-interface/left-panel/module-tree) and can access the [Project directory](/working-with-hise/hise-interface/left-panel/project-directory) and [API Browser](/working-with-hise/hise-interface/left-panel/api-browser) tabs.
