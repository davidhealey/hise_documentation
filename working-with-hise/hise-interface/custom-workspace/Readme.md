You can open the Custom Workspace through the menu with **View > Show Custom Workspace**.

It is a workspace that can be fully customized with [Layout-](/ui-components/floating-tiles/layout) and **HISE floating tiles**.

**Right-click** on the "Empty" tile to add any of the [Hise Floating Tiles](/ui-components/floating-tiles/hise) from the dropdown menu.

If you want to compartmentalise the interface you can enable the [Layout Mode](/working-with-hise/menu-reference/view#enable-layout-mode) with **View > Enable Layout Mode** and add new interface separations (Vertical and Horizontal tiles).
